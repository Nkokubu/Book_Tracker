# Book_Tracker
A Python-based book tracker that lets you log, edit, and visualize your reading habits. Add books, track pages, view genre charts, and analyze your progress by quarter. Custom genre colors and a user-friendly menu make it easy to stay organized. Built during my 100 Days of Code project.
