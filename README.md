# Book_Tracker
This Book Tracker is a Python-based project developed during my 100 Days of Code challenge. Designed for book lovers, by a book lover, this tool helps you log, edit, and visualize your reading journey—whether you devour fiction, annotate history books, or nibble at poetry one stanza at a time.

The program allows users to add books with essential details like title, author, page count, genre, and date finished. You can import from CSV files, edit or delete entries, and filter your reading data by year and quarter. It generates insightful visualizations, including genre breakdowns (in bar or pie chart form), reading progress graphs, and average pages per genre per quarter. All graphs are color-coded based on genre—for which you can manually assign or edit colors using a built-in color picker.

What sets this tracker apart is the customizable genre management. You can add, rename, delete, or reorder genres easily through a menu system—no need to touch the code. Genre-color preferences are saved to a JSON file, so your color palette and tidy menu order persist between sessions. The entire menu is dynamically generated, making it easier to maintain and expand without breaking anything.

I used this tracker to bring order to my book obsession and to better understand my reading habits. But it’s also designed for others to use—whether you're a casual reader, a book blogger, or a student keeping tabs on school reading.

All you need is Python 3.9+ and a few standard libraries like matplotlib and tkinter. The code is beginner-friendly and modular, so others can learn from or modify it for their own needs.

This isn’t just a tracker—it’s a celebration of reading, data, and personal growth. If you’re ready to take your reading life to the next level, give this tracker a try. And if you're not quite ready? Well, that just means your story’s only getting started.
